This is a repository for my own project to create my homepage for our school network, which would be mainly functional page to ease our weekday
The plan:
	Create a webpage, that can be pushed to ranssi.
	Functionalities it should have:
		A page for people giving their shopping lists:
			All orders are sorted by the orderer and are visible on page
			Adding order:
				Option 1:
					a simple textbox, where orders can be written and which parses afterwards the order and adds it to database.
				Option 2:
					Items are added to database, possibly with price, and items are chosen by either writing and then choosing from options (or creating a new one), or clicking from dropdown menus
				Database is on cloud, or possibly on ranssi. It includes the orders (and possibly items and prices)
			Editing order:
				Like on ranssi, so checkboxes to edit specific items and buttons to do something (like "delete these" or "move these to this guys order"
			Paying methods
			Looks semi-nice
			Time till next trip
			Estimated total weight (calculate only drinks {because they are the weight})
			Do something about old orders (maybe history)
			Nice stats are nice
			When user enters the page, stuff from server is loaded (and updated every so often), it's pushed back when user presses specific button (or tries to leave the page and presses the button to send order)
			DOESN'T CRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
